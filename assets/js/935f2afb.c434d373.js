Bitcoin\'s protocol works very differently from other blockchain protocols that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, and the types of contracts that are supported are more limited. Despite those limitations, Bitcoin smart contracts have proven to be surprisingly flexible, supporting applications such as payment channels, cross-chain atomic trades, and more. Future protocol upgrades\u2014and improvements in tooling\u2014may make it possible to build increasingly sophisticated applications on top of Bitcoin.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"language/ExampleContracts":{"id":"language/ExampleContracts","title":"Example Contracts","description":"Below are some examples of contract templates written in Ionio.
